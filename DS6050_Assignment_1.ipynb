Moreover, there is no gap between the training and validation accuracy, suggesting that the model we used has low capacity, and that we should increase its size. On the other hand, with a very large model we would expect to see more overfitting, which would manifest itself as a very large gap between the training and validation accuracy.\n",

You might also consider tuning the learning rate decay, but you should be able to get good performance using the default value.\n",
